3.	Rating Analysis: The majority of ratings fell between 4 and 5, with only two outliers at ratings 1 and 2. This reflects an overall high satisfaction level.
4.	Prominent Themes: Commonly used words in reviews included ride, park, show, good, place, and parade, indicating frequent mentions of key attractions and experiences.
5.	Sentiment Insights: Negative feedback often centered on wait times and crowd management during peak seasons, while positive reviews highlighted the quality of shows and parades.

Techniques and Tools Used:
•	Data Processing: Cleaned and structured data from 10,000 reviews.
